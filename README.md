# Probabilistic-Quantum-Algorithm-for-comparing-two-integers
Here, I made a new probabilistic way entirely different from the previous shor’s approach. It encodes our two
integers in the probability amplitude. And then, by measuring the state in the
computational basis, we can know which is the bigger number. There is already a way to use a part of Shor’s algorithm to compare two integers by encoding them to basis states but this completely different from that.
